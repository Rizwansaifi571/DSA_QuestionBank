# 📚 DSA Question Bank

This repository contains my **day-wise** solutions to **Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA)** problems. The goal is to enhance my **problem-solving skills** and strengthen my understanding of **DSA concepts** through consistent practice.

## 📌 About the Repository
- Organized **day-wise** for structured learning and progress tracking.
- Covers a variety of **DSA topics**, including:
  - Arrays, Linked Lists, Stacks, Queues
  - Trees, Graphs, Recursion, Dynamic Programming
  - Sorting, Searching, Greedy Algorithms, and more
- Solutions are implemented exclusively in **C++**.
- Each solution is well-commented and optimized for **time and space complexity**.

## 🎯 Goals
- Solve **at least one problem daily**.
- Cover **a wide range of DSA topics** to build a strong foundation.
- Improve **coding efficiency** and **problem-solving techniques**.
- Track **progress** and refine solutions over time.

## 📖 How to Use
- Clone the repository:
  ```bash
  git clone https://github.com/Rizwansaifi571/DSA_QuestionBank.git
  ```
- Navigate to the desired **day's folder** and check the solutions.
- Run the code in your preferred **C++ environment**.

## 🚀 Future Plans
- Add **detailed explanations and approaches** for each solution.
- Provide **alternative solutions** with different complexities.
- Implement a **topic-wise index** for easy navigation.
